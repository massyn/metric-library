New requirement - effective immediately"
PCI DSS v4.0-3.2.1,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.,"3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following: • Coverage for all locations of stored account data. • Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details. • Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal or regulatory, and/or business requirements.  • Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification.  • Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy. • A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.  Applicability Notes Where account data is stored by a TPSP (for example, in a cloud environment), entities are responsible for working with their service providers to understand how the TPSP meets this requirement for the entity. Considerations include ensuring that all geographic instances of a data element are securely deleted. The bullet above (for coverage of SAD stored prior to completion of authorization) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.3.1,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.3 Sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization.,"3.3.1 SAD is not retained after authorization, even if encrypted. All sensitive authentication data received is rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process Applicability Notes This requirement does not apply to issuers and companies that support issuing services (where SAD is needed for a legitimate issuing business need) and have a business justification to store the sensitive authentication data.  Refer to Requirement 3.3.3 for additional requirements specifically for issuers.  Sensitive authentication data includes the data cited in Requirements 3.3.1.1 through 3.3.1.3."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.3.1.1,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.3 Sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization.,"3.3.1.1 The full contents of any track are not retained upon completion of the authorization process. Applicability Notes In the normal course of business, the following data elements from the track may need to be retained:  • Cardholder name. • Primary account number (PAN). • Expiration date. • Service code. To minimize risk, store securely only these data elements as needed for business."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.3.1.2,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.3 Sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization.,3.3.1.2 The card verification code is not retained upon completion of the authorization process. Applicability Notes The card verification code is the three- or four-digit number printed on the front or back of a payment card used to verify card-not-present transactions.
PCI DSS v4.0-3.3.1.3,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.3 Sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization.,"3.3.1.3 The personal identification number (PIN) and the PIN block are not retained upon completion of the authorization process. Applicability Notes PIN blocks are encrypted during the natural course of transaction processes, but even if an entity encrypts the PIN block again, it is still not allowed to be stored after the completion of the authorization process."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.3.2,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.3 Sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization.,"3.3.2 SAD that is stored electronically prior to completion of authorization is encrypted using strong cryptography.  Applicability Notes Whether SAD is permitted to be stored prior to authorization is determined by the organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers). Contact the organizations of interest for any additional criteria. This requirement applies to all storage of SAD, even if no PAN is present in the environment. Refer to Requirement 3.2.1 for an additional requirement that applies if SAD is stored prior to completion of authorization. This requirement does not apply to issuers and companies that support issuing services where there is a legitimate issuing business justification to store SAD).  Refer to Requirement 3.3.3 for requirements specifically for issuers.  This requirement does not replace how PIN blocks are required to be managed, nor does it mean that a properly encrypted PIN block needs to be encrypted again.  This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.3.3,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.3 Sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization.,"3.3.3 Additional requirement for issuers and companies that support issuing services and store sensitive authentication data: Any storage of sensitive authentication data is:  • Limited to that which is needed for a legitimate issuing business need and is secured. • Encrypted using strong cryptography.  Applicability Notes This requirement applies only to issuers and companies that support issuing services and store sensitive authentication data.  Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data.  PCI DSS requirements are intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit account data, including issuers. The only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. Any such data must be stored securely and in accordance with all PCI DSS and specific payment brand requirements.  (continued on next page) The bullet above (for encrypting stored SAD with strong cryptography) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.3.3 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.4.1,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy account data is restricted.,"3.4.1 PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed), such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN. Applicability Notes This requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for displays of cardholder data—for example, legal or payment brand requirements for point-of-sale (POS) receipts. This requirement relates to protection of PAN where it is displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., and is not to be confused with Requirement 3.5.1 for protection of PAN when stored, processed, or transmitted."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.4.2,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy account data is restricted.,"3.4.2 When using remote-access technologies, technical controls prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN for all personnel, except for those with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need. Applicability Notes Storing or relocating PAN onto local hard drives, removable electronic media, and other storage devices brings these devices into scope for PCI DSS. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.5.1,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.5 PAN is secured wherever it is stored.,"3.5.1 PAN is rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored by using any of the following approaches:  • One-way hashes based on strong cryptography of the entire PAN.  • Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN). • Index tokens. • Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures.  • Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN, or different truncation formats of the same PAN, are present in an environment, additional controls are in place to ensure that the different versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. Applicability Notes It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. This requirement applies to PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception, or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected.  This requirement does not preclude the use of temporary files containing cleartext PAN while encrypting and decrypting PAN."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.5.1.1,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.5 PAN is secured wherever it is stored.,"3.5.1.1 Hashes used to render PAN unreadable (per the first bullet of Requirement 3.5.1), are keyed cryptographic hashes of the entire PAN, with associated key-management processes and procedures in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. Applicability Notes This requirement applies to PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception, or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected.  This requirement does not preclude the use of temporary files containing cleartext PAN while encrypting and decrypting PAN.  This requirement is considered a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment."
PCI DSS v4.0-3.5.1.2,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data,3.5 PAN is secured wherever it is stored.,"3.5.1.2 If disk-level or partition-level encryption (rather than file-, column-, or field-level database encryption) is used to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows : • On removable electronic media OR • If used for non-removable electronic media, PAN is also rendered unreadable via another mechanism that meets Requirement 3.5.1.  Note: Disk or partition encryption implementations must also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key-management requirements.  Applicability Notes While disk encryption may still be present on these types of devices, it cannot be the only mechanism used to protect PAN stored on those systems. Any stored PAN must also be rendered unreadable per Requirement 3.5.1—for example, through truncation or a data-level encryption mechanism. Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is appropriate only for removable electronic media storage devices.  Media that is part of a data center architecture (for example, hot-swappable drives, bulk tape-backups) is considered non-removable electronic media to which Requirement 3.5.1 applies.

Applicability Notes The requirement for MFA for non-console administrative access applies to all personnel with elevated or increased privileges accessing the CDE via a non-console connection—that is, via logical access occurring over a network interface rather than via a direct, physical connection.  MFA is considered a best practice for non-console administrative access to in-scope system components that are not part of the CDE."
PCI DSS v4.0-8.4.2,PCI DSS v4.0,Requirement 8: Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components,8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.,"8.4.2 MFA is implemented for all access into the CDE. Applicability Notes This requirement does not apply to:  • Application or system accounts performing automated functions. • User accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by cashiers on point-of-sale terminals). MFA is required for both types of access specified in Requirements 8.4.2 and 8.4.3. Therefore, applying MFA to one type of access does not replace the need to apply another instance of MFA to the other type of access. If an individual first connects to the entity’s network via remote access, and then later initiates a connection into the CDE from within the network, per this requirement the individual would authenticate using MFA twice, once when connecting via remote access to the entity’s network and once when connecting via non-console administrative access from the entity’s network into the CDE. (continued on next page) The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includes access directly to an entity’s networks or systems as well as web-based access to an application or function.  MFA for remote access into the CDE can be implemented at the network or system/application level; it does not have to be applied at both levels. For example, if MFA is used when a user connects to the CDE network, it does not have to be used when the user logs into each system or application within the CDE. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment."

Applicability Notes The requirement for MFA for remote access originating from outside the entity’s network applies to all user accounts that can access the network remotely, where that remote access leads to or could lead to access into the CDE. If remote access is to a part of the entity’s network that is properly segmented from the CDE, such that remote users cannot access or impact the CDE, MFA for remote access to that part of the network is not required. However, MFA is required for any remote access to networks with access to the CDE and is recommended for all remote access to the entity’s networks. The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includes access directly to an entity’s networks or systems as well as web-based access to an application or function."
